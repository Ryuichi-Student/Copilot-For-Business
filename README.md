I've provided one of my OpenAI API keys - use that though don't spam the API obviously.
If you want to use your own key, just replace the field in .env (but copy the original one down so as not to replace it!).

Use pipreqs --force ./ to generate requirements.txt after new install.

Use streamlit run frontend/Welcome.py to run the app or streamlit run frontend/development.py for testing.
