I've provided one of my OpenAI API keys, but try not to use it too much until we get confirmation of funding. 
If you want to use your own key, just replace the field in .env (but copy the original one down so as not to replace it!).

Use pipreqs --force ./ to generate requirements.txt after new install.

Use streamlit run Welcome.py to run the app or streamlit run frontend/development.py for testing.
